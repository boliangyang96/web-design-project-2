# Project 3: Design Journey

**For milestones, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.**

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either.

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combination, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

## Project 1 or Project 2
> Which project will you add a form to?

Project 1 or 2 (TODO: pick one)


## Audience (Milestone 1)
> Who is your site's target audience? This should be the original audience from Project 1 or Project 2. You may adjust the audience if necessary. Just make sure you explain your rationale for doing so here.

TODO


## Audience's Needs (Milestone 1)
> List the audience's needs that you identified in Project 1 or 2. Just list each need. No need to include the "Design Ideas and Choices", etc. You may adjust the needs if necessary. However, any changes you make to the needs for this project should be clearly identified and justified.

- TODO: Need 1
- TODO: Need 2
- TODO: ...
- ...


## HTML Form + User Needs Brainstorming (Milestone 1)
> Using the audience needs you identified, brainstorm possible options for an HTML form for the site. List each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the HTML form addresses that need.

- TODO
- TODO
- ...


## HTML Form Proposal & Rationale (Milestone 1)
> Make a decision about your site's form. Describe the purpose of your proposed form for your Project 1 or 2 site. Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed form meets the needs of your site's audience.
> Note: If your form is a contact form, we expect to see a thorough justification explaining how a contact form addresses the user's _actual_ needs. In your justification explain how a contact form better suits the needs of your user compared to the alternatives (e.g. sending you an email using your email address).

Form Proposal: TODO

User Needs Rational: TODO


## Form User Data (Milestone 1)
> Think through and plan the data you need to collect from the users. Do you need their name? Email address? etc.

- TODO
- ...


## Form Components & Validation Criteria (Milestone 1)
> For each piece of data you plan to collect from the users, identify an appropriate HTML component to collect that data and decide the validation criteria (e.g. whether this data is _required_). Briefly explain your reasoning for the component choice and the validation criteria.

- TODO
- Name (required): text field; `<input type="text">`
- ...


## Form Location (Milestone 1)
> Which HTML file will you place your form?

TODO (index.html)

> Sketch the location of the form in that page. This sketch need not be fancy. You don't need to provide many details of the page or form. Just plan the location of the form on the page and communicate that to us. You can literally have a box that says "FORM HERE."

**Desktop Location**

TODO


**Mobile Location**

TODO


## Form Design (Milestone 1)
> Include sketches on your form below. Include sketches of your **mobile and desktop** versions without corrective feedback. Show us the evolution of your design and the alternatives you considered.

**Desktop Sketches**

TODO

**Mobile Sketches**

TODO


## Form Feedback Design (Milestone 1)
> Include sketches of your **mobile and desktop** with _corrective feedback_. Show us the evolution of your design and the alternatives you considered.

**Desktop Feedback**

TODO


**Mobile Feedback**

TODO


## Form Implementation Planning (Milestone 1)
> What submission method will your form use? GET or POST. Explain your reasoning.

TODO

> For your site's `<form>` element, plan all HTML attributes that you will need and their values. Hint: action=, method=, novalidate

- `method="TODO"`
- TODO
- ...


## Additional Information (Milestone 1)
> (optional) Include any additional information, justifications, or comments we should be aware of.

TODO


## Plan Validation Pseudocode (Final Submission)
> Write your form validation pseudocode here.

```
TODO
```


## Additional Design Justifications (Final Submission)
> If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet the final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. Use it wisely. However, you don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the final submission design journey.

TODO


## Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> This was the first project in this class where you coded some JavaScript. What did you learn from this experience?

TODO


> Reflect on how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together support client-side interactivity. If it's helpful, you can describe your mental model of client-side interactivity or explain how the general idea of showing and hiding content can be used to implement other forms of client-side interactivity beyond form validation and feedback.

TODO


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!
