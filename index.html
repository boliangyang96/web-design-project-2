          <h2>What Is Apple Harvest Festival?</h2>
          <!-- Source: https://ithacavoice.com/2019/09/apple-harvest-festival-guide-2019-getting-back-to-the-roots/ -->
          <p>Ithaca&rsquo;s annual Apple Harvest Festival is a yearly celebration of everything apple! Every year, the fall festival draws thousands of people — upwards of 40,000 according to past estimates — to Downtown Ithaca to celebrate all things apple. Visitors can sift through baskets of different varieties, from tangy Northern Spy to Cornell&rsquo;s variety Autumn Crisp, sample hard and fresh cider, and of course, enjoy plenty of baked and fried treats for sale, like apple crisp, pie, and doughnuts.</p>
          <p>The festival will take place <strong>Friday through Sunday</strong> on the <strong>Ithaca Commons</strong> and on nearby <strong>Cayuga and West State/MLK Jr. streets</strong>.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>

          <p>The Apple Harvest Festival started as a small harvest festival in 1982 to showcase the area&rsquo;s diverse agricultural products. With heavy involvement from Cornell and a partnership with downtown merchants, including David Abdulky and Lyle McCartney, the event was strictly a farmers&rsquo; market. Over time, the addition of food and craft vendors, games and other activities for children grew the event into what it is today. The event usually attracts more than 30,000 visitors over the three days.</p>
